# clipit: CLI Simple Snippet Manager
It's heavily inspired by [knqyf263/pet](https://github.com/knqyf263/pet) but have some features for my own usage.

## TL;DR
```shell
clipit clip "git push <remote=github|gitlab> <branch=master>"

clipit list

clipit exec "git push <remote=github|gitlab> <branch=master>"
# choose `github` or `gitlab` for `remote` in selectable prompt.
# Variable for <remote=github|gitlab>: 
#    github
#  â–¸ gitlab  
#
# override or use `master` for `branch` in prompt.
# Variable for <branch=master>: master|
```
